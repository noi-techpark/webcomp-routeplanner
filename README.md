# ROUTEPLANNER

CSS styles are transpiled using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).

We are using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for the bundled creation.

[![CI](https://github.com/noi-techpark/webcomp-routeplanner/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/noi-techpark/webcomp-routeplanner/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Getting Started

Follow the instruction here below for the development instructions.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Node (global)
- NPM (global)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Install npm project's dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Development

Start the dev server with

```
npm run  start
```

### Production

Build the widget with the `production` config of Webpack:

```
npm run build
```

The destination for the resulting code will be the `dist` folder, located at the root of the project.

## API Keys

Here maps needs an API key that has to be set in the env variable `HERE_API_KEY` which is set through the [definePlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/)

The EFA/STA api doesn't require API key.

### Attributes

## Custom font
